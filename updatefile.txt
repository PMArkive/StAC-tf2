        "Notes"     "Changes in 5.4.0"
        "Notes"     "- Default stac_max_connections_from_ip to 0, only enable it if you need it because StAC isn't catching bots. If this happens, open an issue on the GitHub!"
        "Notes"     "- Default stac_kick_unauthed_clients to 0, only enable if you're having issues with cheating unauthenticated players."
        "Notes"     "- Better prevention of already banned clients from joining servers and spamming notifications to Discord, thank you Kaiga with Uncletopia for the report."
        "Notes"     "- Tightened up some checks."
        "Notes"     "- StAC now better ignores laggy clients."
        "Notes"     "- StAC no longer whines about an invalid file handle on server start."
        "Notes"     "- StAC no longer reports bhops until a client reaches `stac_max_bhop_detections` or more bhops, instead of half of that number."
        "Notes"     "- Discord webhook stuff has been cleaned up a bit."
